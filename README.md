Introduction
Project Overview
The project focuses on studying the correlation between greenhouse gas emissions and their consequential impacts on Canada's climate. It analyzes temperature fluctuations, the surge in greenhouse gas emissions, and escalating deforestation rates in Canada using various data analysis and visualization tools like PowerBI, Excel, Python, and Pandas.

Domain Knowledge
The report includes domain-specific terminologies to help understand the main factors and measures being analyzed. Key definitions are provided for Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2 eq), Temperature Departure, and Tree Cover Loss.

Data Collection
The project collected temperature and greenhouse gas emission data from Government of Canada platforms and Data marts. It also analyzed deforestation and tree loss data from Global Forest Watch, spanning two decades.

Data Cleaning
Extensive data cleaning was conducted to ensure data integrity and completeness. Missing values were replaced, and irrelevant attributes were omitted to maintain consistency across datasets. New meaningful features were derived from cleaned data to enhance the analysis.

Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
An initial analysis was performed to check for null values and ensure correct data types, ensuring data completeness before further analysis.

Data Modelling
The data was modeled by establishing connections between five distinct tables, allowing for visualization and data exploration. Each table was connected with a one-to-one relationship.

Data Analysis and Visualization
Carbon Dioxide Emissions Analysis
Visualizations showed that the highest sources of emissions are from energy use, with Alberta emitting the highest and Yukon the least. Over 21 years, emissions decreased by 5.63%.

Deforestation and Tree Loss
Tree cover loss fluctuated over two decades, with British Columbia showing the highest loss.

Temperature, Tree Loss, and Carbon Dioxide Emission Trends
Data trends showed correlations between CO2 emissions, tree loss, and temperature fluctuations.

Correlation Analysis
The project highlighted correlations between CO2 emissions and climate change, indicating the impact of emissions on temperature changes.

Prediction and Deep Analysis
Predictive modeling suggested future mean maximum temperature variations based on optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, with the Random Forest Regression model showing the lowest mean square error.

Conclusion and Recommendations
The analysis suggested a correlation between CO2 emissions and climate change, emphasizing the interconnectedness of deforestation, emissions, and temperature fluctuations. Recommendations included broadening the analysis scope and leveraging climate prediction models for better forecasting.
